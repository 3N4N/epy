CLI Ebook Reader.

This is just a fork of my own [epr](https://github.com/wustho/epr) with these extra features:

- Supported formats:
  - Epub (.epub, .epub3)
  - FictionBook (.fb2)
  - Mobi (.mobi), but image is not supported in mobi
  - AZW3 (.azw3), some but not all (see [KindleUnpack](https://github.com/kevinhendricks/KindleUnpack))
- Reading progress percentage
- Bookmarks
- External dictionary integration

# Installation

```shell
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/wustho/epy
```
