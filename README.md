# `$ epy`

CLI Ebook Reader.

This is just a fork of my own [epr](https://github.com/wustho/epr) with these extra features:

- Faster (although only noticeable when reading badly-structured thick ebook)
- FictionBook (.fb2) support
- Mobi (.mobi) support (but no image is supported in mobi)
- Reading progress percentage
- Bookmarks
- External dictionary integration

# Installation

```shell
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/wustho/epy
```
