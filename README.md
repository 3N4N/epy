Yet Another CLI EPUB Reader.

It's just a fork of my own [epr](https://github.com/wustho/epr) with extra feature,
**Reading Percentage** (Which personally, I find it very essential when reading) on right top corner.
It costs a little startup time though.

Press `s` to toggle between show/hide reading percentage.
